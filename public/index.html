            Welcome to my homepage. My name is Cheryl Jia. I am a full stack software engineer.
            I have been working on multiple web services projects includes following two apps
            that are built based on MEAN Stack technology.<br>
            <br>
            I love coding. I want to dedicate myself into making people's life easier and happier.
            In my spare time, I want to help others realize their dreams as well.<br>
            <br>
            When I was 5, I started to learn piano and dance. I also have two-year experience
            on sketches and traditional Chinese painting.<br>
            <br>
            My hobbies:<br>
            I keep a routine on physical exercise especially swimming. I also love traveling.
            I had been in six countries that are included in four continents in 2016. I also
            love fashion, so I built an app named Snatch, which is a fashion recommendation
            app. Finally, I love learning languages, especially before traveling to that country.
            Thus, I know 4 languages, Chinese, English, French, and Portuguese.<br>
            <br>
